Pete Lambert is a singer-songwriter from York, UK. Taking influences from Folk, Americana and Country music, he sings songs about heartbreak, longing and whiskey.

His subtle and emotional finger-style guitar, honest, personal lyrics and heartfelt performances stun audiences.

Yorkshire born and bred but with the soul of a broken cowboy, Pete straddles the Atlantic - which might sound far fetched but actually he has really long legs.

Pete is currently recording his debut album, which will be released in 2023.
