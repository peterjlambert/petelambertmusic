Pete Lambert is a singer-songwriter from York, UK. Taking influences from Folk, Americana and Country music, he sings songs about heartbreak, longing and whiskey.

His subtle and emotional finger-style guitar, honest, personal lyrics and heartfelt performances stun audiences.

An unabashed lover of the ‘sad song’ genre, Pete believes that the intense range of emotions that can be elicited by a song is a powerful thing. As a songwriter, getting those emotions onto paper and then out into the world through performance is one of the most gratifying and cathartic experiences.

Yorkshire born and bred but with the soul of a broken cowboy, Pete straddles the Atlantic - which might sound far fetched but actually he has really long legs.
Pete is currently recording his debut album, “Whiskey, Sadness, Heartbreak”, which will be released in late 2023.
